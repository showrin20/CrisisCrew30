A tech-driven social entrepreneurship solution addressing fire safety and disaster management in Bangladesh. Selected as a **Hult Prize 2025 Semi-Finalist** for its innovative approach to empowering communities and enhancing crisis response.



## 💡 Problem Statement

Fires in Bangladesh, particularly in urban centers like Dhaka, claim lives and cause significant damage due to inadequate resources, poor coordination, and limited public awareness. Between 1999 and 2020, ~285,000 fires occurred, with 2,308 deaths from 2004–2020 (Fire Service and Civil Defence). Key challenges include:

- Lack of credible information and traditional communication methods.
- Inefficient resource allocation and planning.
- Insufficient training and public awareness.
- Limited post-incident analysis.

> *Example*: The Krishi Market Fire (2023) highlighted issues like water shortages and crowd interference, underscoring the need for better coordination (Dhaka Tribune, Sep 15, 2023).



## 🌱 Our Solution

- **Crisis Responder Dashboard**: Gamified platform with levels (Crisis Cadet to Crisis Heroes) for real-time coordination and motivation.
- **Comprehensive Training**: Online/offline workshops, VR simulations, and fire drills.
